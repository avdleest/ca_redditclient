## How this repo was initialized

This repo was initialized with the Redux template of the `yarn` version of `create react-app`: 

`yarn create react-app reddit-client --template redux`


## How to start developing

Start by cloning this repo:

>`git clone https://github.com/avdleest/ca_redditclient.git`

This project is setup with `yarn` instead of `npx` or `npm`, so it works with slightly different commands. After cloning the repository, install the dependencies:
